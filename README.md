Based on the amazing Tensorflow model used in [guesslang](https://github.com/yoeo/guesslang) by [@yoeo](https://github.com/yoeo)

## TODO

* Move into untitled hint workspace contribution in VS Code core
* Change to run every 100 characters or something
* Profile the model for memory and speed
* When should we dispose the model?
